## Project Overview

The Inventory App would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app stores information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It will also allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

## Learning outcomes

* Storing information in a SQLite database
* Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
* Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
* Updating information based on user input.
* Creating intents to other apps using stored information.
